# HW #7 - Train-Scheduler
This project shows the most up-to-date train information and scheduling for the fictional Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo
Train Scheduler. Users have the ability to add information on a new train and can check the status of the existing
trains on the schedule.

## Instructions
Browse the site for existing train information. If you do not see a train and have updated information, please use
the "Add Train" form to schedule a new train. When adding information on a new train, enter in the train
name, destination, the time of the first train (in HH:mm military time), and the frequency in which it arrives (in
minutes). The "Next Arrival (EST)" and "Minutes Away" fields will automatically be calculated after entering in the previous
information.
